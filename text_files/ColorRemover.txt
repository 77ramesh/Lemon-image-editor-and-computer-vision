The point where user click on image, store that point's RGB value in stack. And on process button
click check for every other color in image and calculate euclidean distance between stack colors 
and other colors from image and if the dist is less than 100 then mark it as user selected color's
neighbo (Do it for every stack color). And from where dist comes less than 100, mark that point 
in preview image with white color. Then preview image will show which other colors in the image
are close to user choosen colors.
